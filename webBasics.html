        <p><h3>Early life</h3>
            Grew up in South Trinidad
            Alexandra Daisy Voisin was a deeply religious and devoted 
            person to La Divina Pastora (The Virgin Mary of Siparia). 
            When she ended her mortal reign as 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parang" target="_blank">Parang</a> Queen of 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad" target="_blank">Trinidad 
            and Tobago </a>, her body was returned to the church where, eighteen
            years ago, she had received a message to spread parang 
            throughout the world. And since that time she continued to 
            do just that. She was born at Carapal, Erin on 
            September 23, 1924, in a family consisting of six girls, 
            of which she was the youngest. She was of Spanish and French
            parentage. Her mother, Juliana Hospedales, came from 
            Tocopita, Venezuela. Daisy's father, Mathias Voisin, 
            was of French origin and came from Arima. She received 
            her early education at Lorensotte Government School and
            became a monitor (apprentice teacher). Being a monitor 
            in those days signified brilliance, dedication and 
            conscientiousness. She later taught at the Canadian 
            Mission School in Siparia.

        <p><h4>La Divina Pastora an the...<br />
            Arrival Of The Queen</h4>

            In 1968, she joined the Siparia Village Council, Fyzabad Choir
             and Morne Diablo Group. Her first opportunity to lead the 
             Morne Diablo Choir in parang was in 1974, when the lead 
             singer, Francis Molloy, became ill and had to be hospitalized.
              Her stepfather, Lucien Bravo, whom she called "da da", had 
              given her all the help he could. Her first solo "Aquinaldo" 
              was partly composed by him. Lucien had predicted that she would 
              be a queen one-day. His prediction came true on the night she 
              replaced the lead singer at the Best Village Competition. After 
              that performance there was no turning back for Daisy, who provided 
              in the years that followed, that she was the undisputed queen of 
              Parang in Trinidad and Tobago.
            
            As a lead singer, Daisy assumed new responsibilities, which she 
            carried out with diligence and professionalism. Even though she 
            spoke the Spanish language with a fair degree of accuracy and 
            fluency, she could not write it. With the help of Mrs. Hoyte, 
            a Venezuelan national resident in Siparia, Daisy overcame her 
            initial problems. During her successful reign she composed 
            "Sereno Sereno", "Daisy Voisin", "Daisy Daisy Daisy", "El Nacimiento 
            de la Verdad" and many others. "Alegria Alegria", was however, her
             favorite composition. Leroy Birch, a qualified musician, had helped 
             her to put the finishing touches to this song, which was a big success.

            
            Before her death, she recalled that her most memorable occasion was 
            when she sang for Jose Echevaria, former Venezuelan Ambassador to 
            Trinidad and Tobago. On that occasion, she sang "La Historia Trinitaria"
             which was composed by William Joseph, a Spanish teacher at 
             Presentation College, San Fernando. To see Daisy on stage was an 
             exciting cultural experience. She was explosive, vivacious and 
             tempestuous. She enjoyed every moment on stage.
